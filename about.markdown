Hi! I'm [Miolith](https://miolith.com), a french computer graphics enthusiast and software developer. I created this glossary to help myself and others learn more about the field of computer graphics and rendering.

The field is vast and complex, and it can be difficult to find clear and concise explanations of the many terms and concepts involved. This glossary is my attempt to provide such explanations, and to help others learn more about the field.
