# Nanite

**Nanite** is a virtualized geometry system that allows rendering massive scenes with billions of triangles at a high level of detail. It is based on the idea of virtualized geometry, which means that the geometry is streamed and rendered on demand, allowing for real-time rendering of complex scenes with minimal memory usage.
