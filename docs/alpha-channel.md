# Alpha Channel

The **alpha channel** is a color component that represents the transparency/opacity of a pixel. It's usually an additional channel to RGB in an image between 0 and 1, where 0 is fully transparent and 1 is fully opaque.

## Usage in Computer Graphics

It is used in image formats that support transparency, such as PNG, TIFF, and TGA, to define how a pixel should be blended with the background.
