# PBR / Physically Based Rendering

**Physically Based Rendering** (PBR) is the goal of rendering graphics in a way that more accurately models the flow of light in the real world, as oppososed to only capturing visual features of objects. PBR is based on the physics of light and materials, and aims to produce more realistic images by simulating the interactions between light and surfaces by using concepts such as energy conservation, Fresnel equations, or radiometry.
