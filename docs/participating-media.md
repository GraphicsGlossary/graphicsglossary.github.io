# Participating Media

**Participating media** refers to materials that interact with light in a way that is not purely surface-based. Instead, participating media are materials that allow light to pass through them, scattering and absorbing light as it does so.

## Usage in computer graphics

This can create a variety of visual effects, such as fog, smoke, and other atmospheric effects.
