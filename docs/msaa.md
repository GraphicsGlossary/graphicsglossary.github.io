# MSAA / Multisample Anti-Aliasing

Multisample Anti-Aliasing (MSAA) is a technique used to reduce aliasing artifacts in rendered images. It works by sampling multiple points on polygon edges and blending the results to produce smoother, more accurate images. MSAA is commonly used in real-time rendering to improve the visual quality of 3D graphics.
