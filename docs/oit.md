# OIT / Order-Independent Transparency

**Order-Independent Transparency** is the task of rendering transparent objects in a scene without sorting them based on their depth. It is designed to overcome the limitations of traditional transparency rendering methods, which require sorting objects based on their distance from the camera to achieve correct blending.
