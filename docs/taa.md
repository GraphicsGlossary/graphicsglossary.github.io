# TAA / Temporal Anti-Aliasing

Temporal Anti-Aliasing (TAA) is a technique used to reduce aliasing artifacts in rendered images by blending multiple frames together. TAA works by accumulating the results of multiple frames over time, using motion vectors to align pixels from different frames before blending them together. This helps to smooth out jagged edges and improve the overall visual quality of 3D graphics.
