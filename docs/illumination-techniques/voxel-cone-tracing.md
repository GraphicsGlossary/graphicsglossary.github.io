# Voxel Cone Tracing

Voxel Cone Tracing (VCT) is a technique by Cyril Crassin used in real-time rendering to simulate global illumination effects such as reflections, refractions, and ambient occlusion. It is based on the idea of tracing cones through a 3D grid of voxels to sample the environment and calculate lighting effects.
