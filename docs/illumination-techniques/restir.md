# ReSTIR / Reservoir-based Spatio-Temporal Importance Resampling

**ReSTIR** is a novel algorithm for real-time global illumination that combines the strengths of path tracing and screen-space ray tracing. It is based on the idea of importance resampling, which is a technique that allows the reuse of previously computed samples to improve the quality of the final image. ReSTIR is a spatio-temporal algorithm, which means that it takes into account both the spatial and temporal coherence of the scene to reduce the number of samples needed to achieve high-quality results.
