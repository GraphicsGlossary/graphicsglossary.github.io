# Mie Scattering

Mie scattering is a type of scattering that occurs when light interacts with particles that are similar in size to the wavelength of the light (aerosols). It is responsible for the white color of clouds and the halo that appears around the sun or moon.

## Usage in Computer Graphics

Mie scattering is often used to simulate the appearance of clouds and other atmospheric effects. By modeling the interaction of light with particles in the atmosphere, it is possible to create realistic lighting effects that enhance the visual quality of a scene.
