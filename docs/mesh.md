# Mesh

A **mesh** is a collection of connected vertices, edges, and faces that define the shape of a 3D object in computer graphics. 

## Usage in Computer Graphics

Meshes are used to represent surfaces, specifically in real-time rendering applications like video games and simulations because they can be rendered quickly via the standard graphics pipeline even though they can only approximate smooth curved surfaces and are not as lightweight as other representations like implicit surfaces.
