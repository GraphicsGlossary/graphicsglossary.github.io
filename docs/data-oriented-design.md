# DOD / Data-Oriented Design

**Data-Oriented Design (DOD)** is a programming paradigm that focuses on the organization of data in a way that is optimized for performance. This paradigm comes from the fact that modern hardware has optimizations that require developpers to think about how data is stored and accessed in memory, like cache coherency, SIMD instructions, and memory alignment.
