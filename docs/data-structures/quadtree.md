# Quadtree

A **Quadtree** is a tree data structure where each node has 0 or 4 children.

## Usage in Computer Graphics

Quadtrees are used to partition 2D space into smaller equal regions. This is particularly useful for spatial indexing and collision detection in 2D scenes. Quadtrees are also used in image compression algorithms, where they can be used to represent images at different levels of detail.
