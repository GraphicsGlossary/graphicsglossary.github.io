# Isosurface

An **isosurface** is a surface that is drawn by plotting all the points in a 3D space that have the same value. This value is called the **isovalue**.

## Usage in Computer Graphics

Isosurfaces are used in computer graphics to visualize 3D data. They are commonly used in scientific visualization to represent scalar fields, such as temperature, pressure, or density.

They are also used in fragment shaders to create complex shapes and effects. For example, metaballs are a type of isosurface that can be used to create organic shapes.
