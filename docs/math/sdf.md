# SDF / Signed Distance Function/Field

A **signed distance function (SDF)** is a mathematical function that describes the distance from a point in space to the surface of an object. The function returns a positive value if the point is outside the object, a negative value if the point is inside the object, and zero if the point is on the surface of the object.

## Usage in Computer Graphics

SDFs when combine to ray marching can be used to render complex shapes and scenes in real-time. They are particularly useful for rendering fractals, organic shapes, smooth surfaces, and other geometrically complex objects that are difficult to represent with traditional polygonal meshes.
