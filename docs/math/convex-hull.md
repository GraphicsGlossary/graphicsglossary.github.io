# Convex Hull

**convexity** is a property of a set of points where, for any two points in the set, the line segment connecting them lies entirely within the set. For a polygon, **convexity** implies that all its interior angles are less than 180 degrees.

**The convex hull** of a set of points is the smallest convex polygon that encloses all the points in the set.
