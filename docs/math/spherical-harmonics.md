# Spherical Harmonics

Spherical Harmonics are a set of mathematical functions defined on the surface of a sphere. They are commonly used in computer graphics and physics simulations to represent and approximate lighting, sound, and other phenomena that exhibit spherical symmetry.


## Usage in Computer Graphics

Sphereical Harmonics are used to approximate the lighting of a scene. They are used to represent the incoming light at a point on a surface, and can be used to calculate the outgoing light from that point. This is useful for real-time rendering, as it allows for efficient global illumination calculations.
