# Radiosity

**Radiosity** is a global illumination algorithm that simulates diffuse reflection and emission of light between surfaces in a scene.

The technique divides the scene into small patches and computes the amount of light that is reflected between each pair of patches. The algorithm is based on the principle of energy conservation, which states that the total amount of light energy in a closed system remains constant.

## Usage in Computer Graphics

Radiosity is used in the context of offline rendering to produce high-quality images with realistic lighting effects. The algorithm is particularly well-suited for scenes with diffuse surfaces, such as architectural interiors, where indirect lighting plays a significant role in the overall appearance of the scene.
