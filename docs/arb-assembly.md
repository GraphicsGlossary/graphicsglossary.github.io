# ARB Assembly

ARB Assembly (short for "Architecture Review Board Assembly") is a low-level shading language used in early versions of OpenGL for programming vertex and fragment shaders. It was introduced as an extension to OpenGL 1.4 and was later replaced by the more flexible and powerful GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language).
