# Pixel

A **pixel** (short for "picture element") is the smallest unit of a digital image or graphic that can be displayed on a screen. Even though it is represented as a rectangular area, a pixel is a sampling point that stores color information. Pixels are arranged in a grid to form the image, with each pixel representing a single color value.
