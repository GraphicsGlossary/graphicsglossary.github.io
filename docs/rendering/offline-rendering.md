# Offline rendering

**Offline rendering** is the process of generating images or animations from a scene using a renderer that is not limited by real-time constraints. This allows for more complex algorithms and higher-quality results compared to real-time rendering.

## Usage in computer graphics

Offline rendering is commonly used in film production to create high-quality visual effects and animations. The longer rendering times are acceptable in this context because the final output is not required in real-time.
