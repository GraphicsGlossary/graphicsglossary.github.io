# Ray Tracing

**Ray tracing** is a rendering technique that simulates the way light interacts with objects in a scene. For each pixels, rays are cast into the scene, finding within the scene which surfaces intersect with the ray, then simulating a bounce off these surfaces to calculate the final color of the pixel.

## Usage in Computer Graphics

Ray tracing enables the creation of realistic images by simulating the physical behavior of light rays.
