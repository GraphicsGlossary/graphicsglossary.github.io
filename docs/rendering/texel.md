# Texel

A **texel** (short for "texture element") is the smallest unit of a texture map used in computer graphics. It represents a single pixel in a texture image and is used to store color, transparency, and other information that can be applied to 3D models during rendering.

It could be used interchangeably with the term "pixel" in the context of texture mapping, as both refer to the smallest unit of a digital image. However, the term "texel" is more commonly used in the context of textures to distinguish it from the pixels of the screen.
