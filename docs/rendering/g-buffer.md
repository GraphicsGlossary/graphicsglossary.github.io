# G-Buffer

The G-Buffer, short for Geometry Buffer, is multiple frame buffers filled with per-pixel geometric data at the geometry shader stage of the rendering pipeline. It is used in modern rendering engines to store intermediate rendering results, such as position, normal, albedo, and other material properties, to be used in later stages of the rendering pipeline.
