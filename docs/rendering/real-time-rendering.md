# Real-time rendering

**Real-time rendering** is the process of generating images or animations from a scene in a short amount of time, typically at interactive rates (at least 15 images per seconds) or real-time rates (at least 30 images per second). This is in contrast to offline rendering, which can take minutes, hours, or even days to produce a single frame because the final output is not required in real-time.

## Usage in Computer Graphics

It is used in video games, simulations, and other interactive applications where the user's input needs to be processed and displayed in real-time.
