# Rasterization

**Rasterization** is the process of converting geometry into pixels by projecting the geometry onto a 2D plane and determining which pixels on the plane are covered by the geometry.

## Usage in computer graphics

Rasterization is a fundamental step in the rendering pipeline of modern graphics hardware. You can assume that every real-time application uses rasterization to render 3D scenes to a 2D screen.
