# OKLab

**OKLab** is a color space designed to be perceptually uniform, meaning that the distance between two colors in the Oklab space is proportional to the difference in perception of these colors, making it thus more appropriate for color blending and color palette generation.

It's made of three components: L (lightness), a (green-red), and b (blue-yellow). The L component represents the lightness of the color, while the a and b components represent the chromaticity of the color.
