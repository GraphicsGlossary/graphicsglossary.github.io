# Photometry

**Photometry** is the science of measuring visible light in terms of its perceived brightness to the human eye. It is used to quantify the amount of light emitted by a source, the amount of light received by a surface, and the amount of light perceived by an observer.

It's generally opposed to radiometry, which works with objective measurements of light energy, regardless of how it's perceived by humans.
