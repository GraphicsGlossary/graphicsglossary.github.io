# SM / Shader Model

A **Shader Model (SM)** is a version of the shader programming language used in graphics processing units (GPUs) to define how the GPU processes vertices, pixels, and other data. Shader Models are typically associated with a specific generation of GPU hardware and are used to describe the capabilities and features of the GPU.
