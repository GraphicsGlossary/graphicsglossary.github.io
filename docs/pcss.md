# PCSS / Percentage Closer Soft Shadows

**Percentage Closer Soft Shadows (PCSS)** is a shadow mapping technique that aims to produce soft shadows by filtering the shadow map based on the distance between the light source and the occluder. It is an extension of the Percentage Closer Filtering (PCF) technique that adds a soft transition between shadowed and lit areas.
