# BLAS / Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms

Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) are a set of low-level routines for performing common linear algebra operations such as vector addition, scalar multiplication, dot products, and matrix multiplication. BLAS routines are widely used in scientific computing and are the foundation for many higher-level linear algebra libraries such as LAPACK and Eigen.
