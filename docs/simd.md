# SIMD / Single Instruction, Multiple Data

Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD) is a parallel computing technique that allows a single instruction to perform the same operation on multiple data points simultaneously.

This also refers to the hardware capabilities of modern CPUs and GPUs to execute SIMD instructions such as SSE (Streaming SIMD Extensions), AVX (Advanced Vector Extensions), and NEON (ARM SIMD Architecture). These instruction sets provide a way to process multiple data elements in parallel in a single thread.
