# The Graphics Glossary
## (Site under construction)

The Graphics Glossary is a collection of terms with explanations, rather than strict definitions, related to computer graphics and rendering.

Use the search bar above to find a specific term, or browse the list at the left.

I sacrifice some technical depth and truth for clarity and accessibility, so if you're looking for more detailed or advanced information, I recommend checking out the resources linked at the end of each page. Also feel free to suggest corrections or improvements by Twitter [@Miolith_](https://x.com/Miolith_) or by email at **mioliths@gmail.com**.

More convenient ways to suggests changes or improvements will be added in the future.
